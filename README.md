# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-with-Principal-Component-Analysis-andk-Nearest-Neighbors
My buddy and I created our first own machine learning project that was required for a class we took in college.
We took the project furhter than all the other students. This is what sparked my intertest into machine learning.
---------------Motive----------------

In our machine learning  class we are given bi-weekly projects from our proffessor. One project was to use Linear Discrimnate Analysis(LDA) on the mnist dataset. 
Our final project took the mnist dataset and wanted to achieve a better accuracy than our proffesors(87.3%). We used Principal Compenent Analysis(PCA) to reduce our features and k-Nearest Neighbors(kNN) to classify the handwritten digits. We were able to achieve an accuracy of 95.55%

------------------Code Operation------------------
In order to run the code from 'PCAkNNmnist.py', you must save and store 'mnist_test.csv' and 'ClassHelper.py' into the same folder.

---------------Report-----------------
The report for the project is also included as 'PCA_and_kNN_for_mnist.pdf'

Please take a look at my first project that sparked my interest into machine learning!
