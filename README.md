# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-with-Principal-Component-Analysis-andk-Nearest-Neighbors
My buddy and I created our first own machine learning project that was required for a class we took in college.

We took the project furhter than all the other students. This is what sparked my intertest into machine learning.
--------------------------------------------------Technical Info-----------------------------------------------------

In our machine learning  class we are given bi-weekly projects from our proffessor. One project was to use Linear Discrimnate Analysis(LDA) on the mnist dataset. 
Our final project took the mnist dataset and wanted to achieve a better accuracy than our proffesors(87.3%). We used Principal Compenent Analysis(PCA) to reduce our features and k-Nearest Neighbors(kNN) to classify the handwritten digits. We were able to achieve an accuracy of 95.55%

Please take a look at my first project that sparked the interest into machine learning!
